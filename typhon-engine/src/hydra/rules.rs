//! Workflows: conditions in, actions out.
//!
//! An automation people otherwise write as a cron script -- "file it under
//! `done` when it finishes", "seed for two days then stop". The shape is the
//! one qui settled on and it is the right one: a tree of AND/OR groups rather
//! than a flat list, because the flat list forces you to write the same rule
//! three times the first moment you want "tracker A or tracker B".
//!
//! This module imports NOTHING from the rest of Hydra. That is structural, not
//! stylistic: a condition that needed a live engine to evaluate could not be
//! unit tested, so the type system is what stops one being added. Everything
//! arrives as `Facts`, a flat struct someone else fills in.
//!
//! Conditions compile ONCE into closures. A pass looks at three hundred
//! thousand torrents; parsing "500GiB" or building a regex per torrent per rule
//! is the difference between a background task and a stall.
