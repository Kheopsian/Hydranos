//! The engines, running inside this process.
//!
//! This module is the reason 4.0.0 exists. In 3.x the Go front spoke to each
//! engine over a unix socket and kept its own copy of every torrent's state to
//! answer HTTP with: 313 call sites maintaining that copy, 1.62 GiB of live Go
//! heap at 243k torrents, and 6.6 KB more for every torrent added.
//!
//! Here a handler holds an `Arc<TorrentManager>` and reads the engine's own
//! DashMap. There is no second copy to keep in step, so there is nothing to
//! fall out of step: the class of bug where the UI showed a stale figure
//! because a refresh had not run yet cannot be written any more.
//!
//! Each engine is then put on the network by `typhon_engine::session::start`,
//! the same function the standalone engine binary calls. Sharing it is the
//! point: two copies of "how an engine comes up" would drift, and the way they
//! drift is silent -- a listener that binds differently, a switch applied to
//! one and not the other.
//!
//! `HYDRANOS_ENGINE_NET=0` holds every engine off the network: the managers are
//! built and their state loaded, and no socket is opened. It is an environment
//! variable and not a config key on purpose -- `/api/settings` echoes the
//! config file back verbatim, so a key here would change an answer that has to
//! stay byte-for-byte what 3.x sends, and 4.0.0 promises an unchanged config
//! file. The differential bench runs its candidate this way.
