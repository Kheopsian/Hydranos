//! What each engine actually looks like from outside.

//! The header shows an exit address per engine. Measuring it once for the

//! leaking outside its tunnel would look exactly like one inside it -- which is
//! the failure this measurement exists to catch. Each engine is therefore
//! probed through its own binding.
//!
//! Nothing here ever publishes a guess: an engine whose probe did not answer
//! reports no address at all, because a stale or borrowed address on this row
//! is how an operator concludes a tunnel is holding when it is not.
