//! BEP 19 webseed — "GetRight" style HTTP seeding from the `url-list` key.
//!
//! Some publishers ship torrents that have **no BitTorrent seeder at all**:
//! the tracker only exists so downloaders find each other, and the bytes come
//! from an HTTP mirror named in `url-list`. Internet Archive is the canonical
//! case — every one of its ~88M items carries a `url-list` pointing at
//! `archive.org/download/<item>/`, and none of them has a seed. Without this
//! module such a torrent sits at 0% for ever, with no error to explain it.
//!
//! Shape: a small fixed pool of workers, NOT one task per torrent. A catalogue
//! of a million torrents cannot afford a task each, and the useful parallelism
//! is bounded by the HTTP origin anyway (measured against archive.org: 2.4 MB/s
//! at one stream, 51 MB/s at 32 — still climbing, so the cap is a courtesy as
//! much as a limit).
//!
//! Each worker claims a torrent, drives it as far as it can, and releases it.
//! Claims live in `CLAIMED` so two workers never fight over the same picker.
