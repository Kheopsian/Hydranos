//! The torrent row the API publishes.
//!
//! This is a faithful port of `engine.TorrentStats` and the two functions that
//! fill it, `LtStatusToTorrentStats` and `DeriveState`. Three things about it
//! are contractual and none of them are guessable:
//!
//!   * **Field order.** Go's encoding/json writes a struct in DECLARATION
//!     order, not sorted. serde does the same, so the fields below are kept in
//!     exactly the order the Go struct declares them. (A map is different: Go
//!     sorts map keys, which is why /api/settings, built from a map, matches
//!     while being alphabetical.)
//!   * **omitempty.** In Go it drops the field when the value is the zero
//!     value. An absent field and a field set to "" are different bytes, and
//!     clients written against 3.x see the difference.
//!   * **Where each value comes from.** Several fields are the STORE's value
//!     with the engine's as a fallback -- added_time, completed_time,
//!     save_path. Taking the engine's first would have been the obvious
//!     reading and it is wrong: the bench caught completed_time doing exactly
//!     that on 486 real torrents.
