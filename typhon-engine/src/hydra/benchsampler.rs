//! The writer behind the benchmark graphs.
//!
//! Every five seconds it appends one row of headline counters to
//! `bench_samples`, and one row per tracker to `tracker_samples`. 3.x sampled
//! at exactly this interval and the graphs assume that spacing, so the figure
//! is a contract rather than a tuning knob.
//!
//! Without this task the graphs are not wrong, they are empty -- and an empty
//! graph and a node that moved no bytes look identical. That is the whole
//! reason the sampler is a module of its own: the endpoints can only ever
//! answer what something else recorded.
