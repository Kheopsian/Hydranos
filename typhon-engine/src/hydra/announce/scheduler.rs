//! One scheduler and a fixed pool of workers, for any number of torrents.
//!
//! 3.x first ran one goroutine per torrent. At 65k torrents that left ~63k
//! parked goroutines whose stacks the garbage collector had to walk, and the
//! scan alone measured 25% of CPU -- about seven cores, found by pprof on
//! 2026-07-22. The fix was this shape: one scheduler owning a heap of
//! deadlines, N workers, and a count of tasks that does not depend on the
//! catalogue.
//!
//! Tokio has no such collector, so the original reason does not carry over --
//! but the shape still does. 244k sleeping tasks are 244k futures held in
//! memory, each with its own state, for work that is idle by definition: a
//! torrent announces once every thirty minutes.
//!
//! The scheduler owns `states` and the heap outright and never locks them. The
//! workers only ever speak through channels.
