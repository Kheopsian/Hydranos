//! Announcing to trackers.
//!
//! In 3.x this was the Go control plane's job -- the Rust engine's
//! `start_announce_loop` is the dial queue consumer, not this. Hydra 4 has no
//! control plane to defer to, so it lives here.
//!
//! Nothing else in the process tells a tracker we exist. When this is not
//! running, the engines seed, listen and connect, and every tracker forgets
//! about all of it within an announce interval.
