//! image, and if anything is wrong switches back, with the same database
//! underneath and nothing to migrate. A schema improvement smuggled in along the
//! way would turn that rollback into a restore from backup.
//!
//! The columns below were read off the live production database rather than off
//! the Go source, and the two were checked against each other: a table built in
//! one CREATE and a table grown by years of ALTER can disagree on column order
//! even when the code says otherwise. Here they agree exactly, appended columns
