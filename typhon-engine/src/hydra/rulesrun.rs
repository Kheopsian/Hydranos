//! Running workflows: gather the facts, match, then act.
//!
//! Deliberately separate from `rules`, which is pure. Everything that needs an
//! engine, a store or a clock lives here, so the matching logic stays testable
//! without any of them.
//!
//! ## The two-phase pass, which is not an optimisation
//!
//! Matching walks the engine's torrent map; applying stops torrents, edits the
//! store and can start a data move. Doing the second inside the first would
//! hold the engine's map for the whole duration of the actions -- on a rule
//! matching a few hundred torrents that is long enough to be felt everywhere
//! else. So: collect the matches, drop everything, then act.
