//! Asking a home router to forward a port (UPnP IGD).
//!
//! The companion of `portfwd`, which speaks NAT-PMP. The two solve the same
//! problem for different equipment: NAT-PMP is what a VPN gateway answers --
//! Proton's, notably -- and almost no consumer router does. A home box speaks
//! IGD, over SSDP and SOAP. Supporting only one of them means half our users
//! get no mapping at all and cannot seed to anyone who is not already dialling
//! them.
//!
//! Done by hand rather than with a crate, for the same reason `portfwd` is:
//! the protocol is three requests, and a public repository is a worse place to
//! add a dependency than a private one.
//!
//! The sequence:
//!   1. SSDP -- a UDP multicast asking who is an InternetGatewayDevice. The
//!      answer carries a LOCATION, the URL of a description document.
//!   2. That document lists services; the one that maps ports is
//!      `WANIPConnection` or, on older ADSL boxes, `WANPPPConnection`.
//!   3. SOAP `AddPortMapping` on that service's control URL, renewed for as
//!      long as we want the mapping to live.
